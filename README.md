# Pixel Starships Discord Bot

This is a Discord Bot for Pixel Starships, targeted for hosting on Heroku

## 1. Setup for Hosting on Heroku

1. Fork this repository to your own Github account
2. Create a Heroku account and log in to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com)
3. Choose New > Create New App, select a region and click 'Create'.
4. Under the deploy tab, connect to your Github account, and select this repository.
   Select the button to enable automatic deploys or use a manual deploy.
5. Under the overview tab, choose "Configure Dynos".
   Enable the option where it says worker: `python src/bot.py`.
6. Obtain a bot token from the
   [Discord developer page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).
7. Under settings, choose "Reveal Config Vars".
   Enter `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` as the variable name.
   Enter the value from the bot token retrieved earlier.

## 2. Self-Hosted Setup

1. Log in to the server (this is optional if you are running from
   a local computer).  For example, if you
   [launched](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine)'
   an Amazon Web Services Virtual Machine, this would be:

```bash
ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/my_key_file.pem ec2-user@hostname
```

where your Amazon AWS instance key file is `my_key_file.pem`
and the username and address above should be changed to that
of your instance running on AWS.

2. Install Python 3.6 and Git.
   On an Amazon AMI, this would be:

```bash
sudo yum install python36 python36-pip git
```

3. Clone this Github repository
   Use pip to install Python dependencies:
   `asyncio`, `holidays`, `numpy`, `pandas`,
   `python-dateutil`, `pytz`,
   `git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jzx3/heroku-pss.git
cd heroku-pss/
python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a Discord Bot.  A good guide is Sebi's bot tutorial.
   The link to the tutorial is [here](https://discord.gg/GWdhBSp).

   Get the invite link for the Discord bot and add the bot to the
   Discord chat.

   Get the Discord bot token from https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
   Add the bot token to `~/.bash_profile` as follows:

```bash
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="insert_bot_token_here"
```

## 2. Running the Bot

Inside the server, create a `screen` session to run the job
in the background. Note that it is not necessary to use
`screen`--the job can be run in the background in other ways,
for example using the `nohup` command.

```bash
cd $HOME/heroku-pss/
screen -S pss    # Create a screen session named "pss"
while true; do python36 src/bot.py; sleep 5; done
```

Press Ctrl-A, Ctrl-D to exit the screen session.
To get back to the screen session (e.g. for stopping the bot),
restore the session with:

```
screen -r pss
```

To stop the bot, press Ctrl-C twice.

## 3. Bot Usage on Discord

Inside Discord chat, get the list of commands using:

```
